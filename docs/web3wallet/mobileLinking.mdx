# Mobile Linking

:::info Note

This feature is only available for iOS and Android.

:::

## Usage

Communication between a mobile wallet and a mobile application is possible by design. Using the URI displayed by the QR-code it is possible to establish connection by sharing this URI via deep-link.

Using the URI commonly displayed in the QRCode it is possible to establish a connection by sharing this URI through a deep link or universal link on both Android and iOS.

The pattern we chose to adhere for a consistent UX across platforms for connection establishment is the following:

::info
1. Dapp prompts user to connect
2. User presses button to connect and is shown a list of iOS compatible wallets
3. User is redirected to the wallet of choice
4. Wallet prompts user to approve or reject session
5. Return To Dapp
    1. Wallet prompts user to return to Dapp manually
    2. Wallet automatically returns to Dapp
6. User returns to Dapp
::

Similar pattern happens when signing requests are required from the user:

1. Dapp redirects user automatically to previously chosen wallet
2. Wallet prompts user to approve or reject request
3. Return To Dapp
    1. Wallet prompts user to return to Dapp manually
    2. Wallet automatically returns to Dapp
4. User returns to Dapp

In order for dApps to be able to trigger your wallet for a connection or sign request using deep links you first need to add your custom scheme under [`CFBundleURLTypes`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/cfbundleurltypes) key in your Info.plist file.
```ruby
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
	<dict>
		<key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
		<string>Editor</string>
		<key>CFBundleURLName</key>
		<string>$(PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER)</string>
		<key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
		<array>
			<string>examplewallet</string> <!-- your custom scheme goes here -->
		</array>
	</dict>
</array>
```
</PlatformTabItem>
<PlatformTabItem value="android">
In order for dApps to be able to trigger your wallet for a connection or sign request using deep links you first need to declare an [`<intent-filter>`](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/deep-linking#adding-filters) in your Manifest.xml as follows:

```xml
<intent-filter>
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
    <data android:scheme="examplewallet" /> <!-- your own custom scheme -->
</intent-filter>
```
</PlatformTabItem>

Since Flutter leverages on native APIs, you must follow iOS and Android steps for each native platform.

__Additionally__, you would have to set FlutterDeepLinkingEnabled key to true on iOS's Info.plist file.

```xml
<key>FlutterDeepLinkingEnabled</key>
<true/>
```

#### iOS Wallet Support

iOS has some more caveats to the integration but we ensure to make it as straightforward as possible. Since its operating system is not designed to handle multiple applications subscribing to the same deep linking schema, we've designed the Web3Modal to list supporting wallets on our [Explorer](https://walletconnect.com/explorer) and target specific deep links or universal links for each wallet.

To add your own wallet to the Explorer, login to your [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/sign-in) account.

```bash
# For deep links
examplewallet://wc?uri=wc:94caa59c77dae0dd234b5818fb7292540d017b27d41f7f387ee75b22b9738c94@2?relay-protocol=irn&symKey=ce3a2c7724c03cf1769ba8b1bdedad5414cc7b920aa3fb72112b997d1916266f

# For universal links
https://example.wallet/wc?uri=wc:94caa59c77dae0dd234b5818fb7292540d017b27d41f7f387ee75b22b9738c94@2?relay-protocol=irn&symKey=ce3a2c7724c03cf1769ba8b1bdedad5414cc7b920aa3fb72112b997d1916266f
```

Additionally when there is a signing request triggered by the dapp it will hit the deep link with an incomplete URI, this should be ignored and not considered valid as it's only used for automatically redirecting the users to approve or reject a signing request.

```bash
# For deep links
examplewallet://wc?uri=wc:00e46b69-d0cc-4b3e-b6a2-cee442f97188@2

# For universal links
https://example.wallet/wc?uri=wc:00e46b69-d0cc-4b3e-b6a2-cee442f97188@2
```

#### iOS App Link Constraints

When using WalletConnect on iOS and triggering a wallet interaction (e.g. when sending a transaction or signing a message), you may experience issues where the native app is not opened as expected and a browser navigation occurs instead. For some wallets (e.g. [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me)) this will present a fallback website, while other wallets (e.g. [MetaMask](https://metamask.io)) will redirect to the App Store.

This issue occurs because app links on iOS will only open the native app when the following rules are followed:

- **The wallet interaction must be triggered by a user-initiated event,** e.g. in a click handler rather than on page load or in an asynchronous callback.
- **The wallet interaction must be triggered as soon as possible within the event handler.** Any preceding asynchronous work (e.g. estimating gas, resolving an ENS name, fetching a nonce) should have already completed before the event handler fires. This may require you to design the user experience around this constraint, preventing users from initiating a wallet interaction until it's ready rather than doing the work lazily.

**Note that even if your own code follows these rules, libraries you depend on may be running their own asynchronous logic before triggering a wallet interaction.** For example, [Ethers asynchronously populates transactions before sending them.](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/signer/#Signer-sendTransaction) Known workarounds are documented below, but if you're still experiencing these issues, you should raise them with the relevant library maintainers.

#### For Ethers v5

These are the known workarounds for avoiding app linking issues on iOS when using [Ethers v5](https://docs.ethers.io/v5).

#### When sending a transaction

<ul>
<li>__[`signer.sendTransaction`](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/signer/#Signer-sendTransaction) should be avoided in favor of [`signer.sendUncheckedTransaction`](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/providers/jsonrpc-provider/#JsonRpcSigner-sendUncheckedTransaction)__<br />
&nbsp;This avoids an asynchronous call to retrieve the internal block number which Ethers uses to resolve a complete [`TransactionResponse`](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/providers/types/#providers-TransactionResponse) object.<br />
&nbsp;Note that as a result of this optimization, `sendUncheckedTransaction` returns a mock transaction response that only contains the `hash` property and a `wait` method. All other properties are `null`.</li>
<li>__The transaction's `to` property should be a plain address rather than an ENS name__<br />This avoids an asynchronous call to automatically resolve ENS names during the send process.<br />
&nbsp;If you still want to support ENS name resolution, you should manually run [`provider.resolveName`](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/providers/provider/#Provider-ResolveName) ahead of time, storing the result before the user attempts to send a transaction. Do not resolve ENS names in the event handler.</li>
<li>__The transaction's `gasLimit` property should be set__<br />This avoids the asynchronous work performed in `sendTransaction` which automatically estimates the gas limit if it's missing.<br />
&nbsp;If you still want to use the same gas limit estimation logic from `sendTransaction`, you should manually run [`provider.estimateGas`](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/providers/provider/#Provider-estimateGas) ahead of time, storing the result before the user attempts to send the transaction. Do not estimate gas in the event handler.</li>
</ul>

#### When calling a write method on a contract

<ul>
<li>__[`contract.METHOD_NAME`](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/contract/contract/#contract-functionsSend) should be avoided if favor of calling [`contract.populateTransaction.METHOD_NAME`](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/contract/contract/#contract-populateTransaction) ahead of time, then sending the populated transaction with [`signer.sendUncheckedTransaction`](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/providers/jsonrpc-provider/#JsonRpcSigner-sendUncheckedTransaction).__</li>
<li>When sending the populated transaction, you should [follow the same guidelines as regular transactions](#when-sending-a-transaction) to avoid any asynchronous logic breaking the app link navigation. Do not populate the contract transaction in the event handler.</li>
</ul>

#### When signing a message

- If the message depends on the result of an asynchronous call (e.g. retrieving a nonce when implementing [Sign-In With Ethereum](https://login.xyz)), you should do this work ahead of time, storing the result before the user attempts to sign the message. Do not perform this asynchronous work in the event handler.

#### WalletConnectRouter

#### Overview

WalletConnectRouter simplifies navigation by automatically redirecting users back to the DApp after they've interacted with a wallet via a deep link. This eliminates the need for users to manually navigate back after approving a session or confirming a transaction.

#### Key Features

**Automatic Redirection:** By invoking WalletConnectRouter.goBack(uri: "example://")—where "example://" is the DApp's custom scheme as declared in their AppMetadata redirect field—users are seamlessly returned to the DApp.

#### Important Consideration

**Mandatory redirect Field:** Starting with WalletConnect SDK version 1.9.5, specifying the redirect field in the AppMetadata object is mandatory to avoid redirection issues.

#### Installation and Usage

```swift
import WalletConnectRouter

try await Sign.instance.approve(proposalId: <proposalId>, namespaces: <namespaces>)

if let uri = proposal.proposer.redirect?.native {
    WalletConnectRouter.goBack(uri: uri)
} else {
    // Inform the user to manually return to the DApp
}
```
#### Limitations

Automatic redirection to browser-based DApps after wallet interaction is not possible from iOS 17 onwards. Developers should adjust their app's UI to inform users about manual navigation back to the browser. For iOS versions below 17, WalletConnectRouter.goBack(uri: uri) facilitates automatic redirection.

#### Android Wallet Support

**Disclaimer:** The below solution is designed for the communication between native Android dapps and native Android wallets. In the case of mobile browser dapps and native Android wallets communication, we recommend moving wallets into the background after both approving and rejecting sessions or approving and rejecting requests to persist smooth deep-link UX.

In order to add support for mobile linking within your wallet and receive session proposals, register following deep link in your mobile wallet using intent filters in your Activity/Fragment or deepLink tag in your navigation graph.

Deep link example: `examplewallet://wc?uri={pairingUri}`

To receive signing request in your Wallet, you'll need to initialize Kotlin SDK with the `Redirect` object where you pass a deep link that redirects to your wallet when it comes to receiving signing request from Dapp.

```kotlin
val redirect = "examplewallet://request" //should be unique for your wallet

val appMetaData = Core.Model.AppMetaData(
    name = "Wallet Name",
    description = "Wallet Description",
    url = "Wallet Url",
    icons = listOfIconUrlStrings,
    redirect = redirect
)

CoreClient.initialize(relayServerUrl = serverUrl, connectionType = connectionType, application = application, metaData = appMetaData)

val init = Wallet.Params.Init(coreClient = CoreClient)
Web3Wallet.initialize(init)
```

**Heads-up:** To make this flow working well, Wallet must register one of its Android components with the same deep link that it initialized with.

To check the flow implementation described above have a look on our sample wallet:
https://github.com/WalletConnect/WalletConnectKotlinV2/tree/master/sample/wallet

#### Dapp Support

To send session proposals to mobile wallet user the pairing URI as deep link that triggers a wallet to open and consume pairing URI

```kotlin
requireActivity().startActivity(Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, deeplinkPairingUri.toUri()))
```

In order to add support for mobile linking within your Dapp and receive signing request responses from wallet, you'll need to initialize Kotlin SDK with the `Redirect` object where you pass a deep link that redirects to your Dapp when it comes to receiving signing request responses from wallet.

```kotlin
val redirect = "kotlin-dapp-wc://request" //should be unique for your Dapp

val appMetaData = Core.Model.AppMetaData(
    name = "Wallet Name",
    description = "Wallet Description",
    url = "Wallet URL",
    icons = listOfIconUrlStrings,
    redirect = redirect
)

CoreClient.initialize(relayServerUrl = serverUrl, connectionType = connectionType, application = application, metaData = appMetaData)

val init = Sign.Params.Init(core = CoreClient)
SignClient.initialize(init)
```

**Heads-up:** To make this flow working well, Dapp must register one of its Android components with the same deep link that it initialized with.

To check the flow implementation described above have a look on our sample Dapp:
https://github.com/WalletConnect/WalletConnectKotlinV2/tree/master/sample/dapp

Either you are a dApp requesting an action to a wallet or a Wallet redirecting back to the dApp after it the idea is to call the [redirect option passed through the PairingMetadata](wallet-usage?platform=flutter#initialization)

Most common way for Flutter developers is to use `url_launcher` package and call `launchUrlString()`

So a dapp would request a session approval to a Wallet as follows:
```dart
launchUrlString('examplewallet://wc?uri=$encodedUri', mode: LaunchMode.externalApplication);
```

And the wallet would call back to the dapp as simple as this:
```dart
launchUrlString('exampledapp://', mode: LaunchMode.externalApplication);
```

where `examplewallet://` or `exampledapp://` is the custom scheme declared in the `redirect` field for `AppMetadata`
