# Overview

WalletConnect Dart v2 library for Flutter, heavily inspired by the WalletConnect V2 Javacript Monorepo.  
Original work for this library is attributed to [Eucalyptus Labs](https://eucalyptuslabs.com/) and Sterling Long for [Koala Wallet](https://koalawallet.io/), a wallet built for the Kadena blockchain.

## Getting Started

To use the WalletConnect Dart v2 library for Flutter, you can start by installing it in your project. You can find the Dart GitHub repository for the library [here](https://github.com/WalletConnect/WalletConnectDartV2).
