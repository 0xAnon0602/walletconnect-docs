# Authorization Signatures

When a user wants to use an app or wallet with notifications, they must sign a SIWE message with their account granting that app access to view and manage their notifications. The SIWE message varies depending if the app is requesting access to manage all app notifications, or just that app's own notifications. Below are the two possible SIWE messages the user would be requested to sign:

- [This app](this-app)
- [All apps](all-apps)
