# Domain Setup

Follow these steps to obtain a Notify API Secret and enable your domain to send notifications.

During development it is optional to use your production domain for testing. Instead, you can use a staging domain, or even a entirerly separate domain e.g. Vercel test site. However, because notification subscriptions are tied to the domain, once you move to production you will need to deploy these files to your production domain.

For a quick start to experiment with, you can try the [gm-hackers template](https://github.com/WalletConnect/gm-hackers) and following the steps in the README.

## Enable notifications

1. In [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com), navigate to the APIs tab of your project.

   <img className="image-margin" src={useBaseUrl('/img/w3i/1.png')} />

2. Under Notify API > Configuration > `DAPP INFORMATION`, fill in the Dapp URL field. This is the domain of your app that you will use to publish notifications.

   <img className="image-margin" src={useBaseUrl('/img/w3i/dapp-info.png')} />

3. Under the same section, next to Notification types, click on the "Add Notification Type" button and add a title and description for your notification type. This is the type of notification that your app will publish.

   For example, if you are going to send promotional content as notification, you might want to add a notification type called "Promotional" with a description "Promotional content from the XYZ Team.".

<img className="image-margin" src={useBaseUrl('/img/w3i/notification-type.png')} />

4. Optionally, you can add a logo and description for your project. This will be shown to users when they subscribe to your app. Click "Save" to save your changes.

5. Take note of your new Notify API Secret. You will need this to publish notifications. This secret
   allows publishing notifications to any account subscribed to your app, so should not be published
   and should only be used by your app backend.
   <img className="image-margin" src={useBaseUrl('/img/w3i/3.png')} />
6. Next, you will need to host `did.json` file on this page at the `/.well-known/` directory of your public URL.
   - Download `did.json` (click on `DID:WEB` section to show the download button ) and host it at, for example, `https://app.example.com/.well-known/did.json`
     <img className="image-margin" src={useBaseUrl('/img/w3i/did.png')} />
7. Once this file has been deployed, switch on the toggle switch in the Notify API section of your WalletConnect Cloud project. If the file is correctly hosted, you should see a success toast: "Notify configuration successfully verified"
   <img className="image-margin" src={useBaseUrl('/img/w3i/5.png')} />
   <img className="image-margin" src={useBaseUrl('/img/w3i/6.png')} />
8. Now you are ready for accounts to subscribe to your app and send notifications to them using your Notify API Secret.
