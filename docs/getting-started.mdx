## What is WalletConnect?

WalletConnect is an open-source protocol that allows you to connect your mobile wallet
to different decentralized applications and other wallets. Historically this has been done through a QR code, which establishes a
secure end-to-end encrypted connection between the two devices. This allows you to interact with dapps and sign transactions securely from your mobile wallet.

WalletConnect is a protocol but we also provide a suite of SDKs to help you build your dapp or wallet.
Whether you're a dapp developer or a wallet developer, we've got you covered.
