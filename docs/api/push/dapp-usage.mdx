# Dapp Usage

WalletConnect Push is a push notification protocol that enables apps to notify users of both off-chain and on-chain events. 
The Push API allows wallet users to register subscriptions for different on-chain or off-chain events that are relevant to the user. 
The notifications are sent to the respective wallets.

## Implementation

<PlatformTabs
	groupId="wcm"
	activeOptions={["web","ios"]}
>
<PlatformTabItem value="web">

:::caution
**The WalletConnect Push SDK is currently in Alpha and is not production-ready**.

Its public API and associated documentation may still see breaking changes.
:::

Install the WalletConnect client package.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @walletconnect/push-client
```

**If you are using the SDK on a server (such as Node.js), you will need to install an additional package:**

```bash npm2yarn
npm install lokijs --save
```

This step is not required if you are using the SDK on the browser-side.

## Enabling Push Notifications for your Dapp

In order to enable push notifications for your dapp, you will need to:

1. Sign up to [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com) and create a project. This will also provide you with a Project ID, which is required for all WalletConnect SDKs.
2. On your project's page, navigate to the `Explorer` tab and fill out the required fields, including the homepage URL of your dapp.
3. Click `Save` to validate and save your project's details.
4. Next, navigate to the `Settings` tab.
5. Under `Push SDK`, download both the `did.json` the `wc-push-config.json` files that have been preconfigured based on your dapp's homepage URL.
6. Host both files in your dapp's `/.well-known` directory, so that they are accessible at `/.well-known/did.json` and `/.well-known/wc-push-config.json` respectively.

## Usage

:::info
The **`PushDappClient` requires an existing pairing** in order to send a push subscription request to the wallet.
This means that the `PushDappClient` should be used alongside the [Sign SDK] or the
[Auth SDK], via the [Shared Core] setup.
:::

**1. Initialize your WalletConnect Core, using [your Project ID], and pass it to the SDK clients**

```javascript
import { Core } from '@walletconnect/core'
import SignClient from '@walletconnect/sign-client'
import { DappClient as PushDappClient } from '@walletconnect/push-client'

const core = new Core({
  projectId: '<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>'
})

// e.g. for SignClient. See the "Shared Core" guide linked above for details.
const signClient = await SignClient.init({
  core,
  metadata: {
    /* ... */
  }
})

const pushDappClient = await PushDappClient.init({
  core,
  metadata: {
    name: 'My Push-Enabled Dapp',
    description: 'A dapp using WalletConnect PushClient',
    url: 'https://my-dapp.com',
    icons: ['https://my-dapp.com/icons/logo.png']
  }
})
```

**2. Add listener for the `push_response` event**

```javascript
pushDappClient.on('push_response', event => {
  if (event.params.error) {
    console.error('Error on `push_response`:', event.params.error)
  } else {
    console.log('Established PushSubscription:', event.params.subscription)
  }
})
```

**3. Propose a push subscription to the wallet**

```javascript
// Resolve known pairings from the Core's Pairing API.
const pairings = pushDappClient.core.pairing.getPairings()
// Use the latest pairing for this example.
const latestPairing = pairings[pairings.length - 1]

const id = await pushDappClient.propose({
  account: 'eip155:1:0xafeb...', // Target account to request push notifications for.
  pairingTopic: latestPairing.topic
})

// Next: The `push_response` event will be emitted once the wallet responds.
```

:::info

- Once `PushDappClient` receives an accepted push subscription from the wallet, it will automatically attempt to register the push subscription with the Cast server at `https://cast.walletconnect.com`.
- The **Cast server's purpose is to allow the dapp to send push messages** to the wallet, **even when there is no active websocket connection**.

:::

### Sending Push Messages via Notify Server (REST)

In order to send a push notification via the WalletConnect Notify server, we can send a `POST` request to the `/notify` endpoint, with the following payload (here via `fetch`):

```javascript
const notificationPayload = {
  // Target `accounts` that should receive the push notification.
  accounts: ['eip155:1:0xafeb...'],
  // The `type` of notification. Based on the notification types defined in your `/.well-known/wc-push-config.json`.
  type: 'alerts',
  // The notification body itself.
  notification: {
    title: 'Profile Activity',
    body: "There's been activity on your profile!",
    icon: 'https://my-dapp.com/icons/logo.png',
    url: 'https://my-dapp.com/profile'
  }
}

// We can construct the URL to the Notify Server using the `castUrl` property
// of the `PushDappClient` (which will be `https://cast.walletconnect.com` by default),
// together with our Project ID.
const result = await fetch(`${pushDappClient.castUrl}/${YOUR_PROJECT_ID}/notify`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(notificationPayload)
})

await result.json() // { "sent": ["eip155:1:0xafeb..."], "failed": [], "not_found": [] }
```

There are two types of push notification a dapp may want to send.

1. Custom Push Nofications: These notifications can be sent from your dapp and are always encrypted. Examples include sending a notification when a user gains a new follower or when someone expresses interest in purchasing their NFT. In this example, we will cover **this** scenario.

2. User Action Push Notifications: Your dapp will send these notifications when you need the user to sign or send a transaction from their wallet. 
Examples include authorizing your dapp or minting an NFT. These actions must be completed before anything happens. 
**Push API is not requried** to send these notifications. To read more about User Action Push Notifications, go [here].

## Add SDK for Your Project.

You can add a WalletConnect SDK to your project with the Swift Package Manager. In order to do that:

1. Open XCode
2. Go to File -> Add Packages
3. Paste the repo GitHub URL: https://github.com/WalletConnect/WalletConnectSwiftV2
4. Tap Add Package
5. Select WalletConnectPush check mark

## Initialization

Make sure Networking and Pairing are properly configured.
- [Networking]
- [Pairing]

### Register for Subscriptions

When your `Push` dapp instance receives a push proposal response or delete request, it will publish a related event. Subscribe to publishers to receive the requests.

```swift
Push.dapp.proposalResponsePublisher
    .receive(on: DispatchQueue.main)
    .sink { [unowned self] id, result in
        //handle event
    }.store(in: &publishers)
```
The following publishers are available for subscription:

```swift
public var proposalResponsePublisher: AnyPublisher<(Result<PushSubscription, PushError>), Never> 
public var deleteSubscriptionPublisher: AnyPublisher<String, Never> 
```

### Request to Send Push Notifications

Once you have an active pairing with a wallet, you are able to send a push subscription proposal on a pairing topic.

```swift
try await Push.dapp.propose(account: Account, topic: String)
```

### Get Active Subscriptions

Get a list of all the active subscriptions.

```swift 
Push.wallet.getActiveSubscriptions()
```

### Where to Go from Here
- Try our [Wallet App](https://github.com/WalletConnect/WalletConnectSwiftV2/tree/main/Example/WalletApp) and to test notifications.
- Build API documentation in XCode: go to Product -> Build Documentation
