# Wallet Usage

<CloudBanner />

## Implementation

<PlatformTabs
	groupId="api"
	activeOptions={["web","ios","android", "react-native"]}
>
<PlatformTabItem value="web">

Install the WalletConnect client package.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @walletconnect/push-client
```

**If you are using the SDK on a server (such as Node.js), you will need to install an additional package:**

```bash npm2yarn
npm install lokijs --save
```

This step is not required if you are using the SDK on the browser-side.

:::info
The **`PushWalletClient` requires an existing pairing** in order to receive a push subscription request from a dapp.
This means that the `PushWalletClient` should be used alongside the [Web3Wallet SDK](../../web3wallet/about.mdx), via the [Shared Core](../core/shared-core.md) setup.
:::

**1. Initialize your WalletConnect Core, using your Project ID, and pass it to the SDK clients**

```javascript
import { Core } from '@walletconnect/core'
import { Web3Wallet } from '@walletconnect/web3wallet'
import { WalletClient as PushWalletClient } from '@walletconnect/push-client'

const core = new Core({
  projectId: '<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>'
})

// e.g. for Web3Wallet. See the "Shared Core" guide linked above for details.
const web3wallet = await Web3Wallet.init({
  core, // <- pass the shared `core` instance
  metadata: {
    /* ... */
  }
})

const pushWalletClient = await PushWalletClient.init({
  core, // <- pass the shared `core` instance
  metadata: {
    name: 'My Push-Enabled Wallet',
    description: 'A wallet using WalletConnect PushClient',
    url: 'https://my-wallet.com',
    icons: ['https://my-wallet.com/icons/logo.png']
  }
})
```

**2. Add listeners for relevant push events**

```javascript
pushWalletClient.on('push_proposal', async ({ id, topic, params }) => {
  const { metadata, account } = params
  // e.g. show a notification to the user, asking them to accept the push subscription request.
})

pushWalletClient.on('push_message', async ({ params }) => {
  const { message } = params
  // e.g. build a notification using the metadata from `message` and show to the user.
})
```

**3. Accept or reject incoming push subscription requests**

To accept a push subscription request, you must provide a callback to the `onSign: (message: string) => string` parameter of the `approve` method.
In order to authorize the push subscription, the SDK will call this callback with a message to sign, expecting the signature for that message to be returned.

Some suggested ways to implement the `onSign` callback are via:

- Ethers.js [`Wallet.signMessage` method](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/signer/#Signer-signMessage)
- The [`signMessage` method](https://wagmi.sh/core/actions/signMessage) in `@wagmi/core`

```javascript
pushWalletClient.on("push_proposal", async ({ id, topic, params }) => {
  // Show a notification to the user with the requesting dapp's metadata, asking them to accept the push subscription request.
  const userAccepted = await showNotificationToUser(params.metadata); // <- your own handler
  if (userAccepted) {
    // The `onSign` callback you provide will be called by the SDK to authorize the push subscription.
    const onSign = async (message: string) => {
      const signature = await wallet.signMessage(message);
      return signature
    }
    await pushWalletClient.approve({ id, onSign });
  } else {
    await pushWalletClient.reject({ id, reason: "User rejected push subscription request" });
  }
```

#### Add SDK for Your Project.

You can add a WalletConnect SDK to your project with the Swift Package Manager. In order to do that:

1. Open XCode
2. Go to File -> Add Packages
3. Paste the repo GitHub URL: https://github.com/WalletConnect/WalletConnectSwiftV2
4. Tap Add Package
5. Select WalletConnectNotify check mark

#### Initialization

Make sure Networking and Pairing are properly configured.
- [Networking](../core/relay.mdx)

#### Configure your project to enable Push Notifications

[Configure Project](https://docs.walletconnect.com/2.0/advanced/echo-server)

#### Configure a Client

Configure the `Notify` instance with:

```swift
try Notify.configure(environment: APNSEnvironment, crypto: CryptoProvider)
```
environment - Use `debug` environment for debug builds and `release` for release and TestFlight builds
crypto - CruptoProvider is a protocol, you are required to provide an implementation of two methods recoverPubKey and keccak256.

#### Register for Push Notifications

In order to enable Push Notifications for your app you need to follow standard procedure:

[Enable Push Notifications Capability](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/registering_your_app_with_apns#2980170)

Ask for user permissions:

call registerForPushNotifications() early in your app's lifecycle to initiate the registration process with Apple Push Notification service:

```swift
    func registerForPushNotifications() {
        UNUserNotificationCenter.current()
            .requestAuthorization(
                options: [.alert, .sound, .badge]
            ) { granted, error in
                guard granted else { return }
                DispatchQueue.main.async {
                    UIApplication.shared.registerForRemoteNotifications()
                }
            }
    }
```


Receive token from Apple Push Notification Services and register it at the Push Server:

```swift
    func application(
      _ application: UIApplication,
      didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data
    ) {
        Task(priority: .high) {            
            try await Notify.instance.register(deviceToken: deviceToken)
        }
    }
```
#
# Subscribe Events


#### Subscribe new subscription

Emits on new subscription created.
```swift
public var newSubscriptionPublisher: AnyPublisher<NotifySubscription, Never> {
```

#### Subscribe Notify Message

Emits new notify message from a dapp.

```swift
public var notifyMessagePublisher: AnyPublisher<PushMessage, Never> 
```

#### Subscribe Subscription Deletion

Emits  a topic of a deleted subscription.

```swift
public var deleteSubscriptionPublisher: AnyPublisher<String, Never> 
```

#### Subscribe Subscription Update

Emits a result of a subscription update, containing updated subscription if successful. 

```swift
public var updateSubscriptionPublisher: AnyPublisher<Result<PushSubscription, Error>, Never> {
```

#### Subscribe Active Subscriptions

Emits a list of active subscriptions.

```swift
public var subscriptionsPublisher: AnyPublisher<[PushSubscription], Never> 
```


#### Create Notify Subscription

To enable seamless communication between a Dapp and a wallet, the wallet must first establish a Notify Subscription. This crucial step allows the Dapp and its associated services to publish notify messages directly to the wallet. Upon granting permission for the wallet's iOS application to display Push Notifications, users will experience real-time updates in the form of push notifications on their devices. For an enhanced user experience, consider subscribing to the `notifyMessagePublisher` channel. This option ensures that notify messages are delivered promptly when the app is active and a web socket connection is established, keeping users informed and engaged.


To subscribe to dapp's notify messages first fetch publicly discoverable dapps with WalletConnet explorer:

https://explorer-api.walletconnect.com/v3/dapps?projectId={your_project_id}&is_notify_enabled=true


and request a subscription directly from the wallet:

```swift
public func subscribe(metadata: AppMetadata, account: Account, onSign: @escaping SigningCallback) async throws {
```
`metadata` - metadata object of publicly discoverable dapp fetched from WalletConnect explorer

`account` - an account you want to associate a sebscription with

`onSign` - callback that requres a signature from a user
 
 
#### Get Active Subscriptions

```swift 
Notify.instance.getActiveSubscriptions()
```

#### Delete Subscription

To delete a subscription.

```swift
try await Notify.instance.deleteSubscription(topic: String)
```

#### Get Notify Messages

To get messages by topic call:

```swift
Notify.instance.getMessageHistory(topic: subscription.topic) 
```

#### Decrypt Push Notifications

All push notifications that are sent via APNs are encrypted and have following payload:

```
{
  "aps":{
    "content-available":1,
    "mutable-content":1
  },
    "ciphertext": String, // encrypted payload
    "topic": String,  //  subscription topic
}
```

In order to decrypt a PN you need to instantiate [UNNotificationServiceExtension](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unnotificationserviceextension).
Learn how to [modify the content in newly delivered notifications](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/modifying_content_in_newly_delivered_notifications).
Create a [keychain group](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services/keychain_items/sharing_access_to_keychain_items_among_a_collection_of_apps) that is shared between your wallet application and the notification service. It must be called `group.com.walletconnect.sdk`.
Import WalletConnectNotify inside your notification service extension file, initialize `NotifyDecryptionService()` and decrypt the message:

```swift
    override func didReceive(_ request: UNNotificationRequest, withContentHandler contentHandler: @escaping (UNNotificationContent) -> Void) {
        bestAttemptContent = (request.content.mutableCopy() as? UNMutableNotificationContent)
        if let bestAttemptContent = bestAttemptContent {
            let topic = bestAttemptContent.userInfo["topic"] as! String
            let ciphertext = bestAttemptContent.userInfo["blob"] as! String
            do {
                let service = NotifyDecryptionService()
                let pushMessage = try service.decryptMessage(topic: topic, ciphertext: ciphertext)
                bestAttemptContent.title = pushMessage.title
                bestAttemptContent.body = pushMessage.body
                contentHandler(bestAttemptContent)
                return
            }
        ...
    }
```

#### Where to Go from Here
- Try our [Wallet App](https://github.com/WalletConnect/WalletConnectSwiftV2/tree/main/Example/WalletApp) and to test notifications.
- Build API documentation in XCode: go to Product -> Build Documentation

<PlatformTabItem value="android">

Kotlin implementation of WalletConnect Push protocol for Android applications.

#### Prerequisite

**Android BOM** ![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.walletconnect/android-bom)

#### Requirements

* Android min SDK 23
* Java 11

#### Implementation
root/build.gradle.kts:
```gradle
allprojects {
 repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
 }
}
```

app/build.gradle.kts

```gradle
implementation(platform("com.walletconnect:android-bom::release_version"))
implementation("com.walletconnect:android-core")
implementation("com.walletconnect:push")
```

#### Getting Started
There are two types of push notification a wallet may want to receive.

1. Custom Push Nofications: These notifications can be rendered within your wallet and are always encrypted. Examples include receiving a notification when you have a new follower or when someone wants to buy your NFT. In this example, we will cover **this** scenario.

2. User Action Push Notifications: Your wallet will receive these notifications when you need to sign or send a transaction. Examples include authorizing your wallet or minting an NFT. These actions must be completed before anything happens. **Push API is not requried** to receive these notifications. 
To read more about User Action Push Notifications, go [here].

#### Implementation

Once you've finished the previous step, you're ready to start implementing the Push API.

#### Initialization

The Push Wallet client is responsible for creating and maintaining subscriptions. To initialize the Push Wallet client, create a `Push.Params.Init` object in the Android Application class with the `CoreClient`. The `Push.Params.Init` object will then be passed to the `PushWalletClient` initialize function.

`PushWalletClient` should be initialized in the Application class.

```kotlin
val projectId = "" // Get Project ID at https://cloud.walletconnect.com/
val relayUrl = "relay.walletconnect.com"
val serverUrl = "wss://$relayUrl?projectId=$projectId"
val connectionType = ConnectionType.AUTOMATIC or ConnectionType.MANUAL
val appMetaData = Core.Model.AppMetaData(
    name = "Wallet Name",
    description = "Wallet Description",
    url = "Wallet URL",
    icons = /*list of icon url strings*/,
    redirect = "kotlin-wallet-wc:/request" // Custom Redirect URI
)

CoreClient.initialize(relayServerUrl = serverUrl, connectionType = connectionType, application = this, metaData = appMetaData)

val init = Push.Params.Init(CoreClient)

PushWalletClient.initialize(init) { error ->
    // Error will be thrown if there's an issue during initialization
}
```

#### Register for Push Notifications

The `PushMessageService` is a wrapper around the `FirebaseMessagingService`. This wrapper class needs to be implemented for the Push SDK to be able to decrypt and notify wallets of a push notification sent from the Dapp in the background. 
This service also needs to be registered in the AndroidManifest.xml file similar to the example in the [FCM documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/client#manifest).

```kotlin
class CustomFirebaseService: PushMessageService() {

    override fun newToken(token: String) {
        // Triggered when Firebase Cloud Messaging creates a new token and that token is registered with the Echo server
    }

    override fun registeringFailed(token: String, throwable: Throwable) {
        // Triggered when Firebase Cloud Messaging if there is an error with registering with the Echo server with a new token
    }

    override fun onMessage(message: Push.Model.Message, originalMessage: RemoteMessage) {
        // Triggered when a message is sent from the Echo server through Firebase Cloud Messaging and the message contains `Push.Model.Message`. The original FCM RemoteMessage is also returned
    }

    override fun onDefaultBehavior(message: RemoteMessage) {
        // Triggered when a message is sent from the Echo server through Firebase Cloud Messaging and the message does not contain `Push.Model.Message`. The original FCM RemoteMessage returned instead
    }

    override fun onError(throwable: Throwable, defaultMessage: RemoteMessage) {
        // Triggered when there is an error that occurs when a message is received from the Echo server
    }
}
```

```xml
<application...>
    <service android:name=".CustomFirebaseService">
        <intent-filter>
            <action android:name="com.google.firebase.MESSAGING_EVENT" />
        </intent-filter>
    </service>
</application>
```

#### Register for Subscriptions

`PushWalletClient` needs a `PushWalletClient.Delegate` passed to it for it to be able to expose asynchronous updates sent from the dapp.

```kotlin
val walletDelegate = object : PushWalletClient.Delegate {

    override fun onPushSubscription(pushSubscribe: Push.Event.Subscription) {
        // Triggered when a wallet initiated subscription has been created
    }

    override fun onPushMessage(message: Push.Event.Message) {
        // Triggered when a message has been sent by the Dapp. The message contains the title, body, icon, and url
    }

    override fun onPushDelete(pushDeletedTopic: Push.Event.Delete) {
        // Triggered when the Dapp deletes the subscription. The pushDelete contains the topic that was deleted
    }

    override fun onPushUpdate(pushUpdate: Push.Event.Update) {
        // Triggered after updating a subscription was successful. The pushUpdate will either contain the updated subscription details or an error
    }

    override fun onError(error: Push.Model.Error) {
        // Triggered when there's an error inside the SDK
    }
}

PushWalletClient.setDelegate(walletDelegate)
```

#### Subscribe to a Dapp
Calling `PushWalletClient.subscribe` will establish the subscription with the dapp specified in the `Push.Params.Subscribe` params passed into the function. The `Push.Params.Subscribe` params requires the uri of the dapp and a CAIP-10 compatible account. To verify ownership over the blockchain account, user's must sign the provided message on the `onSign(message: String)` callback. Currenlty only EIP191 signatures are supported. 

Our recommendation is to show the message to the user and ask the user to either accept or reject the message.
* If the user accepts, then you will need to call `CacaoSigner.sign()` with the message, account private key, and a signature type of SignatureType.EIP191.
* If the user rejects, then you will need to send null as the result of the `onSign` lamda

```kotlin
val subscribeParams = Push.Params.Subscribe(/*Dapp uri*/, /*CAIP-10 account*/, onSign = fun(message: String): Push.Model.Cacao.Signature? { 
    // Message to be signed. When user decides to sign message use CacaoSigner to sign message.
    // CacaoSigner is a util for easy message signing.
    return CacaoSigner.sign(message, /*privateKey*/, SignatureType.EIP191)
    // When users decides to not sign message return null
    return null
})

PushWalletClient.subscribe(
    params = subscribeParams,
    onSuccess = {
        // callback for when the subscription request was successfully sent
    },
    onError = { error: Push.Model.Error ->
        // callback for when the subscription request has failed
    }
)
```

#### Approve Request

To send an approval for the subscription proposal, pass `Push.Params.Approve` to the `PushWalletClient.approve` function to establish a subscription and notify the Dapp. The request id for `Push.Params.Approve` will be available from the `Push.Event.Request` of `onPushRequest` from the PushWalletClient.Delegate. To verify ownership over blockchain account, users must sign the provided message on the `onSign(message: String)` callback. Currenlty only EIP191 signatures are supported. 

Our recommendation is to show the message to the user and ask the user to either accept or reject the message.
* If the user accepts, then you will need to call `CacaoSigner.sign()` with the message, account private key, and a signature type of SignatureType.EIP191.
* If the user rejects, then you will need to send null as the result of the `onSign` lamda

```kotlin
val approveParams = Push.Params.Approve(id = /*request ID*/, onSign = fun(message: String): Push.Model.Cacao.Signature? { 
    // Message to be signed. When user decides to sign message use CacaoSigner to sign message.
    // CacaoSigner is a util for easy message signing.
    return CacaoSigner.sign(message, /*privateKey*/, SignatureType.EIP191)
    // When users decides to not sign message return null
    return null
})

PushWalletClient.approve(
    params = approveParams,
    onSuccess = { 
        // callback for when the approval is successful
    },
    onError = { error: Push.Model.Error ->
        // callback for when the approval has failed
    }
)
```

#### Reject Request

To send a rejection for the subscription proposal, pass `Push.Params.Reject` to the `PushWalletClient.reject` function to reject the subscription request and notify the Dapp. The request id for `Push.Params.Approve` will be available from the `Push.Event.Request` of `onPushRequest` from the PushWalletClient.Delegate.

```kotlin
val rejectParams = Push.Params.Reject(id = /*request ID*/, reason = /*Error Reason*/)

PushWalletClient.reject(
    rejectParams,
    onSuccess = { 
        // callback for when the rejection is successful
    },
    onError = { error: Push.Model.Error ->
        // callback for when the rejection has failed
    }
)
```

#### Update Subscription

To update a subscription, pass `Push.Params.Delete` with the push topic that is to be deleted. If unsuccessful, an error is returned in the callback. The pushTopic can be fetched from the `PushWalletClient.getActiveSubscriptions()`

```kotlin
val pushTopic = // active push subscription topic
val deleteParams = Push.Params.Delete(topic = pushTopic)

PushWalletClient.delete(deleteParams) { error ->
    // callback for when the delete has failed
}
```

#### Delete Subscription

To delete a subscription, pass `Push.Params.Delete` with the push topic that is to be deleted. If unsuccessful, an error is returned in the callback. The pushTopic can be fetched from the `PushWalletClient.getActiveSubscriptions()`

```kotlin
val pushTopic = // active push subscription topic
val deleteParams = Push.Params.Delete(topic = pushTopic)

PushWalletClient.delete(deleteParams) { error ->
    // callback for when the delete has failed
}
```

#### Deletea Push Message

To delete a push message, pass `Push.Params.Delete` with the push topic that is to be deleted. If unsuccessful, an error is returned in the callback. The pushTopic can be fetched from the `PushWalletClient.getActiveSubscriptions()`

```kotlin
val pushTopic = // active push subscription topic
val deleteParams = Push.Params.Delete(topic = pushTopic)

PushWalletClient.delete(deleteParams) { error ->
    // callback for when the delete has failed
}
```

#### Get Active Subscriptions

To get a list of all the active subscriptions, call the `getActiveSubscriptions` function. It will return a map with the topic as the key and `Push.Model.Subscription` as the value.

```kotlin
PushWalletClient.getActiveSubscriptions()
```

#### Get Message History

To get all the messages for a specific subscription topic, call the `getMessageHistory` function by passing an instance of `Push.Params.MessageHistory`. It will return a map with the request ids as the key and `Push.Model.MessageRecord` as the value.

```kotlin
val subscriptionTopic =/*Subscription Topic*/
val messageHistoryParams = Push.Params.MessageHistory(subscriptionTopic)
val mapOfMessages: Map<Long, Push.Model.MessageRecord> = PushWalletClient.getMessageHistory(messageHistoryParams)
```

#### Decrypt Message

To decrypt a message sent by Echo server, pass the topic and encrypted message into `Push.Params.DecryptMessage`. Pass the variable into `PushWalletClient.decryptMessage` and use the `onSuccess` and `onError` callbacks to react to the result. This function is not needed when using the `PushMessageService`.

```kotlin
val encryptedMessage = Push.Params.DecryptMessage(topic = /*topic*/, encryptedMessage = /*encrypted message*/)

PushWalletClient.decryptMessage(
    encryptedMessage,
    onSuccess = { pushMessage: Push.Model.Message -> 
        // callback for when the decryption is successful
    },
    onError = { error: Push.Model.Error -> 
        // callback for when the decryption has failed
    }
)
```

#### Enable Sync

To enable the syncing of subscriptions and messages with multiple devices for an account, call `PushWalletClient.enableSync` and pass an instance `Push.Params.EnableSync` containing the account to sync. 

```kotlin
val account: String = /*Account to sync*/
val enableSyncParams = Push.Params.EnableSync(account)
PushWalletClient.enableSync(enableSyncParams, 
    onSuccess { 
        // callback for when sync is setup successfully for specified account
    },
    onError { error: Push.Model.Error ->
        // callback for when the sync process has failed
    }
) 
```

:::caution
**The WalletConnect Push SDK is currently in Alpha and is not production-ready**.

Its public API and associated documentation may still see breaking changes.
:::

Install the WalletConnect client package.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @walletconnect/push-client
```

:::info
The **`PushWalletClient` requires an existing pairing** in order to receive a push subscription request from a dapp.
This means that the `PushWalletClient` should be used alongside the [Web3Wallet SDK](../../web3wallet/about.mdx), via the [Shared Core](../core/shared-core.md) setup.
:::

**1. Initialize your WalletConnect Core, using your Project ID, and pass it to the SDK clients**

```javascript
import { Core } from '@walletconnect/core'
import { Web3Wallet } from '@walletconnect/web3wallet'
import { WalletClient as PushWalletClient } from '@walletconnect/push-client'

const core = new Core({
  projectId: '<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>'
})

// e.g. for Web3Wallet. See the "Shared Core" guide linked above for details.
const web3wallet = await Web3Wallet.init({
  core, // <- pass the shared `core` instance
  metadata: {
    /* ... */
  }
})

const pushWalletClient = await PushWalletClient.init({
  core, // <- pass the shared `core` instance
  metadata: {
    name: 'My Push-Enabled Wallet',
    description: 'A wallet using WalletConnect PushClient',
    url: 'https://my-wallet.com',
    icons: ['https://my-wallet.com/icons/logo.png']
  }
})
```

**2. Add listeners for relevant push events**

```javascript
pushWalletClient.on('push_proposal', async ({ id, topic, params }) => {
  const { metadata, account } = params
  // e.g. show a notification to the user, asking them to accept the push subscription request.
})

pushWalletClient.on('push_message', async ({ params }) => {
  const { message } = params
  // e.g. build a notification using the metadata from `message` and show to the user.
})
```

**3. Accept or reject incoming push subscription requests**

To accept a push subscription request, you must provide a callback to the `onSign: (message: string) => string` parameter of the `approve` method.
In order to authorize the push subscription, the SDK will call this callback with a message to sign, expecting the signature for that message to be returned.

Some suggested ways to implement the `onSign` callback are via:

- Ethers.js [`Wallet.signMessage` method](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/signer/#Signer-signMessage)
- The [`signMessage` method](https://wagmi.sh/core/actions/signMessage) in `@wagmi/core`

```javascript
pushWalletClient.on("push_proposal", async ({ id, topic, params }) => {
  // Show a notification to the user with the requesting dapp's metadata, asking them to accept the push subscription request.
  const userAccepted = await showNotificationToUser(params.metadata); // <- your own handler
  if (userAccepted) {
    // The `onSign` callback you provide will be called by the SDK to authorize the push subscription.
    const onSign = async (message: string) => {
      const signature = await wallet.signMessage(message);
      return signature
    }
    await pushWalletClient.approve({ id, onSign });
  } else {
    await pushWalletClient.reject({ id, reason: "User rejected push subscription request" });
  }
```
