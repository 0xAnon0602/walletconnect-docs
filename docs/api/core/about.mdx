# Introduction

The Pairing API is a lightweight API for establishing an encrypted, protocol-agnostic communication layer between peers. 
Its purpose is to provide a secure channel for proposing protocols or sending requests between dapp and wallet.

## Installation

WalletConnect currently offers Sign and Auth SDKs. 
To allow a reusable communication channel between peers, 
the Pairing API exposes a standard interface and allows for sending and receiving multi-protocol requests over a single pairing.

Each SDK uses the same implementation of `core/pairing` (via `@walletconnect/core`) to manage pairings. 
To run multiple SDKs side-by-side (e.g. Sign and Auth), please refer to the [Sharing a Core instance] guide.

#### Set up a project

In order to connect to WalletConnect Cloud, you need to create a new project first:

1. Go to https://cloud.walletconnect.com/app
2. Tap New Project
3. Give it a name and tap Create button
4. Your new project should appear on the projects list
5. You should see a project ID string if you tap on your project.
   for more info on Project ID look at Project ID.

### Add SDK for your project.

You can add a WalletConnect Core SDKs to your project with Swift Package Manager. In order to do that:

1. Open XCode
2. Go to File -> Add Packages
3. Paste the repo GitHub URL: https://github.com/WalletConnect/WalletConnectSwiftV2
4. Tap Add Package
5. Select WalletConnectPairing check mark

Kotlin implementation of Android CoreClient for all WalletConnect SDKs. This SDK is developed in Kotlin and usable in both Java and Kotlin files.

![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.walletconnect/android-core)

## Requirements

* Android min SDK 23
* Java 11

## Installation

root/build.gradle.kts:

```gradle
allprojects {
 repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
 }
}
```

app/build.gradle

```gradle
implementation("com.walletconnect:android-core:release_version")
```

## Project set up

To use initialize RelayClient properly you will need a projectId. Go to https://cloud.walletconnect.com/app, register your project and get projectId.

#
## CoreClient initialization

Before using any of the WalletConnect Kotlin SDKs, it is necessary to initialize the CoreClient. The initialization of CoreClient must always happen in the Android Application class. Provide the projectId generated in the WalletConnect Cloud, the WebSocket URL, choose the connection type, and pass the application class. You can also pass your own Relay instance using the `RelayConnectionInterface`.

```kotlin
val projectId = "" //Get Project ID at https://cloud.walletconnect.com/
val relayUrl = "relay.walletconnect.com"
val serverUrl = "wss://$relayUrl?projectId=${projectId}"
val connectionType = ConnectionType.AUTOMATIC or ConnectionType.MANUAL
val application = //Android Application level class
[Optional] val optionalRelay: RelayConnectionInterface? = /*implement interface*/

CoreClient.initialize(relayServerUrl = serverUrl, connectionType = connectionType, application = application, relay = optionalRelay)
```

## Using your own Relay instance
The CoreClient offers the ability to use a custom Relay client. Just creating an instance of `RelayConnectionInterface` and passing it to `CoreClient.initialize`. 

```kotlin
...
val optionalRelay: RelayConnectionInterface = /*implement interface*/

CoreClient.initialize(relayServerUrl = serverUrl, connectionType = connectionType, application = application, relay = optionalRelay)
```
