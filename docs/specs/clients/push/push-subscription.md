# Push Subscription

A Push subscription is an agreement between a dapp and a wallet to receive future push notifications.

A Wallet user will be able to authorize a dapp by sending an authenticated payload with a corresponding identity key and dapp url as described by [Push authentication](./push-authentication.md)

There is however two flows to creating a push subscription:

1. a subscription is proposed by the dapp and approved by the wallet
2. a subscription is subscribed by the wallet and sent to the dapp
