# Custom Wallets

Web3Modal includes wallets from 3 sources: [WalletConnect explorer](https://walletconnect.com/explorer), wagmi connectors and manually defined wallets.
Bellow are defaults for each source:

1. All WalletConnect explorer wallets that satisfy your options will be fetched
2. When using `w3mConnectors` helper, modal includes [WalletConnectConnector](https://wagmi.sh/react/connectors/walletConnect) and [InjectedConnector](https://wagmi.sh/react/connectors/injected)
3. No manual wallets are defined by default

## Custom explorer wallets

You can manage wallets fetched from explorer via [`explorerRecommendedWalletIds`](./options#explorerrecommendedwalletids-optional) and [`explorerExcludedWalletIds`](./options#explorerexcludedwalletids-optional) to prioritise or exclude them from the list.
