# Wallets

Web3Modal has extensive catalog of native mobile, desktop and web wallets that is powered by WalletConnect's [explorer api](https://explorer.walletconnect.com). In addition to this we also support [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh) connectors that enable extension wallet support, as well as custom integrations like [Coinbase wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet), [Safe](https://safe.global) and many others. You can also add wallets manually.

## Managing explorer wallets

By default Web3Modal will use user provided configuration and fetch wallets that satisfy requirements for provided chains. You can disable this behaviour by setting [enableExplorer](../options.md#enableexplorer-optional) to `false`.
