Allows to exclude wallets that are fetched from explorer api [explorer.walletconnect.com](https://explorer.walletconnect.com/?type=wallet). You can define an array of wallet id's you'd like to exclude. You can get / copy these id's from the explorer link mentioned before. If you want to exclude all wallets, you can set this option to `ALL`, however if `explorerRecommendedWalletIds` were defined, they will still be fetched. Defaults to `undefined`.

```ts
explorerExcludedWalletIds: [
  '1ae92b26df02f0abca6304df07debccd18262fdf5fe82daa81593582dac9a369',
  '4622a2b2d6af1c9844944291e5e7351a6aa24cd7b23099efac1b2fd875da31a0'
]
// -- or -- //
explorerExcludedWalletIds: 'ALL'
```
