# Custom Chains

## Custom Chain addition and selection

You can add your chain to the `W3MChainPresets.chains` object **before initialization**:

```dart
W3MChainPresets.chains.putIfAbsent('<chainID>', () => <Your W3MChainInfo>);
await _w3mService.init();
```

:::info
If you modify the presets, it will be reflected in the `W3MNetworkSelectButton` widget.
:::

Or you can select your own chain by calling the `selectChain()` method from `W3MService` **after initialization**:.

```dart
await _w3mService.init();
_w3mService.selectChain(<Your W3MChainInfo>);
```

By using this option, your custom chain is not going to be added to the list of presets, so it's not going to show up in the `W3MNetworkSelectButton`. Use this method if you are not going to display `W3MNetworkSelectButton`.

:::note
The chain must be EVM compatible
