# Custom Chains

:::caution
**The Web3Modal SDK for Flutter is currently in Beta and is not production-ready**.

## Custom Chain Selection

You can select your own chain by calling the `setSelectedChain` method on the `W3MService` object.

The chain must be EVM compatible.

A list of preset chains that are available to you can be accessed at `ChainData.chainPresets`.

If you modify the presets, it will be reflected in the `W3MNetworkSelect` widget.
