# Custom Wallets

:::caution
**The Web3Modal SDK for Flutter is currently in Alpha and is not production-ready**.

It's public API and associated documentation may still see significant and breaking changes.
:::

## requiredNamespaces (optional)

Defaults to null.

This is the initial set of namespaces that will be requested from the wallet.

You can change it at any time with the `setRequiredNamespaces` method.

## featuredWalletIds (optional)

Allows to override default recommended wallets that are fetched from the API. You can define an array of wallet ids you'd like to prioritize (order is respected). You can get these ids from the [WalletConnect Explorer](https://walletconnect.com/explorer?type=wallet) by clicking on the copy icon of desired wallet card. Defaults to `null`.

```dart
final Set<String> featuredWalletIds = {
  'c57ca95b47569778a828d19178114f4db188b89b763c899ba0be274e97267d96', // MetaMask
  '4622a2b2d6af1c9844944291e5e7351a6aa24cd7b23099efac1b2fd875da31a0', // Trust
}
```

## includedWalletIds (optional)

Similar to `featuredWalletIds` this options allows you to override determine which wallets do you want to show. If `includedWalletIds` is set then only the wallets listed in this object are going to be displayed in the modal.

```dart
final Set<String> includedWalletIds = {
  'c57ca95b47569778a828d19178114f4db188b89b763c899ba0be274e97267d96', // MetaMask
  '4622a2b2d6af1c9844944291e5e7351a6aa24cd7b23099efac1b2fd875da31a0', // Trust
}
```

## excludedWalletIds (optional)

This last option is used to exlude a list of wallets from the API response.

```dart
final Set<String> excludedWalletIds = {
  'c57ca95b47569778a828d19178114f4db188b89b763c899ba0be274e97267d96', // MetaMask
  '4622a2b2d6af1c9844944291e5e7351a6aa24cd7b23099efac1b2fd875da31a0', // Trust
}
```
