## recommendedWalletIds (optional)

Allows to override default recommended wallets that are fetched from [WalletConnect Explorer](https://walletconnect.com/explorer?type=wallet). You can define an array of wallet ids you'd like to prioritize (order is respected). You can get these ids from the explorer link mentioned before by clicking on a copy icon of desired wallet card. Defaults to `null`.

```dart
final Set<String> recommendedWalletIds = {
  'c57ca95b47569778a828d19178114f4db188b89b763c899ba0be274e97267d96', // MetaMask
  '4622a2b2d6af1c9844944291e5e7351a6aa24cd7b23099efac1b2fd875da31a0', // Trust
}
```

## excludedWalletState & excludedWalletIds (optional)

The `excludedWalletState` Determines the state of the excluded wallets. Defaults to `ExcludedWalletState.list`.

If the `excludedWalletState` is `ExcludedWalletState.list`, the `excludedWalletIds` will be used to remove items from the list of wallets returned from the [WalletConnect Explorer](https://walletconnect.com/explorer?type=wallet). If the `excludedWalletState` is `ExcludedWalletState.all`, all wallets will be excluded except for the ones defined in `recommendedWalletIds`.
