# About

Your on-ramp to web3 multichain. Web3Modal is a versatile library that makes it super easy to connect users with your Dapp and start interacting with the blockchain.

Built to be framework and use case agnostic, Web3Modal currently supports vanilla html/js and react on the ui side, as well as all EVM compatible chains. We are planning to expand support to more frameworks and chains in the future.

Web3Modal provides first class integration with Wagmi, a library that can help you to dramatically speed up and simplify your development flows.

In case you want to use Web3Modal with another development tooling or integrate with chains that are not yet supported, there is also a standalone mode.
