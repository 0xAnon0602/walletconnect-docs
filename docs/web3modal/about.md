# About

Web3Modal is a versatile library that makes it super easy to connect users with your Dapp and start interacting with the blockchain.

## Features

### Simplified Connection

Web3Modal makes it easy to connect users to your decentralized application and start interacting with the blockchain, without requiring them to manually manage multiple wallets or key pairs.

### Framework and Chain Agnostic

Web3Modal is built to be framework and chain agnostic, which means it can be used with any frontend framework or library and any blockchain.

### Customizable

Web3Modal can be customized to fit your application's specific needs, giving you the ability to tailor the user experience to your users' preferences.
