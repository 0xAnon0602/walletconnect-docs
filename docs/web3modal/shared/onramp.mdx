In order to enable OnRamp on Web3Modal add the `enableOnRamp` flag set as `true` in the `createWeb3Modal` function configuration.

````ts
const modal = createWeb3Modal({
  //...
  chains: [mainnet],
  projectId,
  /* highlight-add-start */
  enableOnRamp: true // Optional - false as default
  /* highlight-add-end */
})
```
