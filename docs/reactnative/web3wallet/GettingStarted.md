# Getting Started

[Web3Wallet SDK](https://medium.com/walletconnect/simplifying-integration-for-wallet-developers-with-the-new-web3wallet-sdk-8706b69e149c) simplifies the integration process for wallet developers by combining our Sign and Auth APIs. Only V2 WCURIs will work with this SDK as V1 is being deprecated by 28 June 2023.

We have written a simple tutorial for Expo on how to get started. This is same approach is applicable for React Native CLI. At any point of development, feel free to reach out via Github Discussions or Discord in the `wallet-dev-support` channel. [ADD LINKS]

# Tutorial

Experimental: For Expo, we have an unofficial npx starter command. `newWallet` represents the name of your project.

```bash
npx create-wc-wallet-expo@latest newWallet
```

This downloads an Expo template with Web3Wallet installed. More information available in the below tutorial
