# Overview

The Echo Server is a push server for the WalletConnect v2 Protocol. It allows clients to send push notifications to their users. The Echo Server can be used alongside our [Push API](../../api/push.md) and [Web3Wallet SDK](../../web3wallet/about.md).

## Options for Receiving Notifications

1. Use the [hosted](./getting-started.md#hosted-platform-recommended) platform (recommended).
2. Self-Host our [server](https://github.com/WalletConnect/echo-server).
3. Write their own implementation using the [spec](https://github.com/WalletConnect/echo-server/blob/main/spec/spec.md).
