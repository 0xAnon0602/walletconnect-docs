# Getting Started

## Hosted Platform (recommended way)

1. Create a Project ID (if you don't already have one, go to [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/) and sign up for an account)

2. Make a POST request to the Echo Server's URL. The URL should be compliant with the Echo Server, but clients can also use their own servers if they are compliant.


SDK teams have their own ways of specifying the URL in the Cloud app.
To use the hosted platform provided by the Echo Server team, go to the Cloud App Project settings.

 TODO Cali is working on this
3. In the Cloud App Project settings, upload an APNs token or certifcate, password, and FCM API key.
(Where can I see these settings)

To get an APNs certificate, refer to Apple's documentation.

The FCM API key is used for Android devices and can also be used for iOS devices by giving it to Google.
