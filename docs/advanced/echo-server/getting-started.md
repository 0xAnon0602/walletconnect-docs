# Getting Started

## Hosted Platform (recommended)

### Prerequirements

1. Create a Project in the Cloud App. Go to [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/) and sign up for an account.

2. To get your project's Push URL, from the Cloud App, go into the settings tab and click on `Create Push URL`.

3. From the same settings tab, add the [FCM](#firebase-cloud-messaging-fcm) and/or [APNs](#apple-push-notifications-apns) details.

### Register Client

Make a POST request to the Echo Server's URL to register your client. Use the URL that you created in step 2.

```
POST <ECHO_SERVER_URL>/clients
{
    "client_id": <CLIENT_ID>,
    "type": <TYPE>,
    "token": <DEVICE_TOKEN>
}
```

- `CLIENT_ID`: The Client's ID from the Relay pairing.
- `TYPE`: The push service to use e.g. APNS, FCM. This will be validated against the supported types on the Echo
  Server's side.
- `DEVICE_TOKEN`: The device's token for the push service e.g. FCM, APNS.

### Unregister Device

```
DELETE <ECHO_SERVER_URL>/clients/<CLIENT_ID>
```

- `CLIENT_ID`: The Client's ID from the Relay pairing.

### Send Notifications

```
POST <ECHO_SERVER_URL>/clients/<CLIENT_ID>
{
    "id": "0000-0000-0000-0000"
    "payload": {
      "topic": "<topic>",
      "flags": <flags>,
      "blob": "<blob>"
    }
```

- `CLIENT_ID`: This is used to map to the device token
- `id`: This is generated by the Relay to prevent duplicate notifications
- `payload`: A string with 3 values encoded and split with a `:` as a delimiter.
  - `topic`: This is used by the SDKs to decrypt encrypted payloads on the client side
  - `flags`: an integer value that uses bitmasks to encode information about the payload for the SDKs, the flags are below.

    ```
    Encrypted  = 1 << 0
    Sign       = 1 << 1
    Auth       = 1 << 2
    Chat       = 1 << 3
    Push       = 1 << 4
    ```

  - `blob`: If the payload is encrypted this is just the encrypted blob, when this is cleartext it should be base64 encoded. The blob should follow the format from of the [Push Message](https://docs.walletconnect.com/2.0/specs/clients/push/data-structures#push-message) 

### Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)

Google's FCM allows you to use send notifications to both Android and Apple devices. At this time, we only support the API. Please refer to their docs on set up.
- [Set up Android](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/client)
- [Set up Apple](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/ios/client)


### Apple Push Notifications (APNs)

Apple recommends using a Token-Based Connection for APNs over a Certificate-Based connection. Please refer to their documentation for instructions on obtaining either.
- [Token-Based Connection](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/establishing_a_token-based_connection_to_apns) 
- [Certificate-Based Connection](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/establishing_a_certificate-based_connection_to_apns)
