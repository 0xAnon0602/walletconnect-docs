Wagmi requires that one or more providers (RPCs) are configured that support all your target chains. Web3Modal provides WalletConnect rpc via `w3mProvider` helper.
WalletConnect rpc `https://rpc.walletconnect.com` is free to use (rate limit may be applied to specific users if abuse is detected). WalletConnect rpc currently supports following chains:

```
1, 3, 4, 5, 10, 42, 56, 69, 97, 100, 137, 280, 324, 420, 42161, 42220, 43114, 80001, 421611, 421613, 1313161554, 1313161555
```

Please refer to [wagmi providers](https://wagmi.sh/react/providers/configuring-chains) documentation to see how to configure alternative providers, combine or prioritize them.

Below is a simplified example of how to combine WalletConnect rpc and Infura one:
