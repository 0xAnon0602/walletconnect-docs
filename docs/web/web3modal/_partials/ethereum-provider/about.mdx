It is easy to integrate Web3Modal as an [EIP-1193](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193) provider together with [`@walletconnect/ethereum-provider`](../../../providers/ethereum). Please note that this approach does not include support for some features like: injected wallet management, account view, chain switching etc. When using web3modal as a provider, we assume you are already managing these yourself.
