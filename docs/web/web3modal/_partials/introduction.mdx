WalletConnect is undergoing protocol migration from v1 to v2, you can learn more in [this blog post](https://medium.com/walletconnect/how-to-prepare-for-the-walletconnect-v1-0-shutdown-1a954da1dbff).
Web3Modal supports both of these protocol versions and makes it easy to switch to v2 once all your target wallets support it.
